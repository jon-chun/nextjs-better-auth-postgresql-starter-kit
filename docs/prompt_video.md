# TITLE: How to Build Features With Claude Code (SIMPLE!)

Please create a detailed implementation plan for the following:

At the moment, we have a boilerplate project, but what we actually want to do is replace it with an actual SaaS application that allows users to upload images of themselves, their friends, their family, or even their pets. This app will then use an AI model to convert the subjects in those images to plushies.

This means that our app needs to have a beautiful landing page where it shows the user the end result so we could show a before and after image and some SEO-optimised text to promote the product. Users should also be able to sign into the application and from the dashboard they should be able to generate images. These images will be stored to their gallery.

This app should also have public-facing documentation on using the application along with all legal documents like privacy pages etc. At this stage I do not want to focus on the back-end logic. We are only focusing on the UI components and nothing else. This will give us a feel for the user experience before moving on to adding the actual back-end logic. Please remember to ask any clarifying questions during this process.

Create a dedicated pricing page with 3 level: basic package (30 credits
      for $9.95), pro package (100 credits for $19.95), and elite packages (200 credits for $29.95)

Please create a subfolder in the specs folder for this specific feature. Within the folder, create two files: requirements.md and implementation-plan.md.

The requirements file should contain our initial requirements, with any other functional and non-functional requirements as well as acceptance criteria.

For the implementation plan, I needed to create a detailed implementation plan that is split into separate phases. Each phase should contain an actionable list of tasks with checkboxes so that we can track our progress. At this stage, do not include any unit or end-to-end testing.

  You can now:
  1. Review the requirements document to ensure all needs are captured
  2. Review the implementation plan to validate the approach
  3. Start Phase 1 (Project Setup) whenever you're ready
  4. Track progress by checking off tasks as you complete them

  Would you like me to proceed with Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation, or would you like to review/modify anything in these documents
  first?

@specs/plushify-me-ui/implementation-plan.md Go ahead and impelment Phase 3 and 4. Mark the tasks complete once you are done.

c: \youtube\plushify\specs\plushify-ui Hey there, we've just implemented all of the phases for this feature. Now, what I want you to do is to review the implementation - the actual coded solution - and see if we missed anything. Please try to identify any gaps or any issues related to the implementation not following **Next.js** and **React best practises**. Use your web search tool to look up any up-to-date documentation related to any libraries or features used in our application.
