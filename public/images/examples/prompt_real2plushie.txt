A professional product photograph of a high-quality handcrafted plushie toy based on this description: [SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION]

PLUSHIE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Made of premium soft fabric (fleece, velour, or minky) with visible texture and subtle fabric grain
- Large expressive button eyes or carefully embroidered eyes with shine highlights
- Embroidered nose, mouth, and facial features with visible thread texture
- Rounded, simplified features maintaining the subject's key characteristics
- Visible topstitching along seams (1-2mm from edges) in matching thread
- Slightly oversized head proportions (1.3x normal) for enhanced cuteness
- Soft stuffed appearance with gentle fabric wrinkles and natural plush curves
- Matte fabric surface with soft light diffusion (not glossy or shiny)

COLOR TREATMENT:
- Slightly more saturated and warmer colors than realistic photos
- Fabric rendering with subtle color variation and texture
- Natural shading from fabric folds and stuffing shape
- Pastel or softened tones while maintaining subject's original color scheme

POSE & COMPOSITION:
- Exact same pose, positioning, and angle as original subject
- Same background setting and environmental context
- Plushie appears to be sitting/standing in the real environment
- Natural shadows and lighting matching the original scene

TECHNICAL EXECUTION:
- Studio-quality product photography aesthetic
- Shallow depth of field with subject in sharp focus
- Soft, diffused lighting from 45-degree angle
- Clean, professional presentation
- Photorealistic fabric rendering (NOT cartoon, illustration, or 3D render)
- The plushie should look like a real, tangible stuffed toy that exists in 3D space

AVOID:
- Cartoon or illustrated style
- Flat 2D rendering
- Overly smooth or plastic-looking surfaces
- Perfect symmetry (plushies have charming imperfections)
- Artificial or digital-looking elements

The final image should look like a professional photograph of an actual premium plushie toy that was handcrafted by a skilled artisan, photographed in the same setting as the original subject.
